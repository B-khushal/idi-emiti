The Team Neuronova has been instrumental in laying the foundational groundwork for the Cultural Corpus Collection Platform. Each member brings unique expertise that has been critical in shaping the project from its initial concept to its current prototype phase, and in planning for its future development.

B. Khushal Prasad, as the Project Lead & Manager, has been guiding the overall direction of the project. Khushal has overseen the initial project setup, including the creation of essential documentation like the README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and LICENSE files. They are responsible for coordinating the team's efforts, ensuring alignment with the refined project vision, and planning the strategic roadmap for future phases, including key integration sprints and deployment considerations.

P. Laxmikanth Reddy, our Backend Developer, is focused on building the robust server-side infrastructure. Laxmikanth has been deeply involved in translating the refined data requirements into a detailed MySQL database schema, which is crucial for handling multimodal data. Their upcoming work includes implementing the core database tables and developing the necessary APIs for data ingestion and management, ensuring the backend can securely store and retrieve all cultural item details and media.

N. Yashwanth Reddy, the Frontend Developer, is responsible for crafting the user-facing experience. Yashwanth has developed the basic Streamlit prototype, providing an initial interface for data submission. Their ongoing efforts are centered on enhancing this prototype to support multimodal file uploads and precise geolocation input, and they are also tasked with implementing Progressive Web App (PWA) features to give the application an accessible, mobile-friendly feel.

M. Manoj, serving as the System Architect, designs the overarching technical blueprint of the platform. Manoj has played a key role in defining the detailed database schema and is now focused on designing a scalable cloud storage strategy for the multimodal media files. Their architectural planning extends to outlining initial AI integration points and recommending suitable cloud AI services, ensuring the system is built for future intelligent capabilities.

T. Sai Rohith, our Data Analytics Engineer, is dedicated to ensuring the quality and integrity of the collected data, and preparing it for advanced analysis. Sai Rohith's initial contributions involve defining and implementing server-side data validation rules for incoming submissions. They are also responsible for researching and prototyping the necessary data preparation steps for feeding audio and visual content into AI models, laying the groundwork for automated data enrichment.

Together, Team Neuronova is committed to systematically building a platform that will not only collect but also preserve and make accessible the rich tapestry of regional Indian cultural heritage.
