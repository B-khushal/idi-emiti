- `db_config.py` - MySQL configuration
- `migrate_to_mysql.py` - MySQL migration script
- `test_mysql_connection.py` - MySQL connection test
- `database_schema.sql` - MySQL schema
- `database_schema_fixed.sql` - Fixed MySQL schema
- `database_schema_with_local_language.sql` - MySQL schema with language support
- `migrate_local_language.sql` - Language migration script
- `MYSQL_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - MySQL setup documentation
- `data/users.json` - Old JSON user storage
- `data/sessions.json` - Old JSON session storage

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `csv_user_manager.py` - Complete CSV-based user management system

### Modified Files
- `auth.py` - Updated to use CSV storage instead of MySQL
- `app.py` - Removed MySQL references, updated database terminology
- `config.py` - Updated translations and messages to reflect CSV storage
- `requirements.txt` - Removed MySQL dependencies

## CSV File Structure

### `data/users.csv`
Stores user account information with the following columns:
- `user_id` - Unique user identifier
- `username` - Username (email prefix)
- `email` - User email address
- `password_hash` - Hashed password
- `full_name` - User's full name
- `bio` - User biography
- `country` - User's country
- `region` - User's region
- `city` - User's city
- `cultural_background` - Cultural background
- `profession` - User's profession
- `location` - User's location
- `created_at` - Account creation timestamp
- `last_login` - Last login timestamp
- `is_active` - Account active status
- `role` - User role (contributor/admin)
- `display_publicly` - Public profile visibility

### `data/sessions.csv`
Stores active user sessions with the following columns:
- `session_token` - Unique session identifier
- `user_id` - Associated user ID
- `created_at` - Session creation timestamp
- `expires_at` - Session expiration timestamp
- `is_active` - Session active status

### `data/user_responses.csv`
Existing file for storing user contributions (unchanged)

## Key Features Implemented

### User Management
- ✅ User registration with email validation
- ✅ Password hashing and verification
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Profile management and updates
- ✅ Password change functionality
- ✅ Account deactivation
- ✅ User statistics and contribution tracking

### Session Management
- ✅ Session creation with expiration
- ✅ Session validation
- ✅ Automatic session cleanup
- ✅ Secure logout functionality

### Data Integrity
- ✅ Unique user IDs using secure tokens
- ✅ Email uniqueness validation
- ✅ Password strength validation
- ✅ Session expiration handling
- ✅ Data persistence across app restarts

## File Upload System
The existing file upload system remains unchanged and continues to work with the local folder structure:
- Images: `uploads/images/`
- Audio: `uploads/audio/`
- Video: `uploads/video/`

All uploaded files are saved with unique UUIDs and the system properly reads and displays files from these folders.

## Benefits of CSV Migration

### Simplicity
- No database setup required
- No complex configuration
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Portable across different environments

### Reliability
- No database connection issues
- No dependency on external services
- Data is always accessible
- Simple backup and restore process

### Performance
- Fast read/write operations for small to medium datasets
- No network latency
- No connection pooling overhead
- Direct file system access

### Development
- Easier debugging and testing
- Simple data inspection
- No database migration scripts needed
- Quick setup for new developers

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
No changes required. The application works exactly the same as before.

### For Developers
1. No database setup needed
2. CSV files are automatically created on first run
3. All existing functionality preserved
4. File uploads continue to work as before

### For Deployment
1. Ensure the `data/` directory is writable
2. CSV files will be created automatically
3. No additional dependencies required
4. Works on any platform that supports Python

## Testing
The CSV system has been thoroughly tested and verified to work correctly with all existing functionality:
- ✅ User registration and login
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Profile updates
- ✅ Password changes
- ✅ File uploads
- ✅ Data persistence
- ✅ Multi-language support

## Testing and Validation

### User Authentication Flow Tested ✅
The complete user authentication flow has been tested and verified:
- ✅ User registration with profile data
- ✅ User authentication with password verification
- ✅ Session creation and management
- ✅ Session validation with proper user data structure
- ✅ Logout and session invalidation
- ✅ User data consistency across all functions

### Key Fix Applied ✅
Fixed the `validate_user_session` function to properly format user data and ensure the `'name'` field is always available, preventing KeyError issues in the application.

## Migration Complete
The migration from MySQL to CSV-based storage is complete and the application is fully functional with improved simplicity and reliability. All user authentication and session management features work correctly.
