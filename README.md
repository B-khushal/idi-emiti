## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Cultural Knowledge Preservation Challenge
In today's rapidly globalizing world, traditional cultural knowledge and artifacts are at risk of being forgotten. Many people encounter traditional objects, tools, and cultural items but lack the knowledge to understand their significance, purpose, or cultural context. This creates a gap between generations and cultures, leading to:

- **Loss of Cultural Heritage**: Traditional knowledge is not being passed down effectively
- **Cultural Disconnect**: People encounter cultural artifacts without understanding their meaning
- **Limited Learning Opportunities**: No interactive platform for cultural education
- **Lack of Community Engagement**: No way for people to share and learn from each other's cultural knowledge
- **Data Collection Gap**: No systematic way to gather and preserve cultural knowledge from diverse communities

### Key Challenges
1. **Accessibility**: Cultural knowledge is often scattered and not easily accessible
2. **Engagement**: Traditional learning methods lack interactivity and user engagement
3. **Diversity**: Need to accommodate multiple languages and cultural perspectives
4. **Scalability**: Solution must be able to handle growing user base and content
5. **Data Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of cultural knowledge
