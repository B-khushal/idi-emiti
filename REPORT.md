# üìä Project Report: Cultural Corpus Collection Platform (Idi-Emiti)

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Cultural Corpus Collection Platform (Idi-Emiti) | ‡∞á‡∞¶‡∞ø ‡∞è‡∞Æ‡∞ø‡∞ü‡∞ø? (What's This?)

**Purpose:** A comprehensive, interactive web-based platform for collecting structured, high-quality multimodal cultural data (images, audio, video) with rich, contextual metadata. This platform successfully builds a robust, multilingual corpus essential for advancing multimodal AI research, fostering linguistic understanding, and preserving invaluable cultural heritage, particularly focusing on regional Indian languages.

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND DEPLOYED**

## 2. Problem Statement: The Structured Cultural Data Deficit

In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, a critical gap exists in the availability of structured, high-quality data pertaining to diverse cultural artifacts and linguistic nuances, especially for regional Indian languages. This leads to:

* **Deterioration of Traditional Knowledge:** Risk of losing valuable traditional knowledge without digitized, contextualized records.

* **Inaccurate Cultural Contextualization:** Existing datasets often lack the rich cultural and linguistic context necessary for accurate AI model training.

* **Absence of Dedicated Data Repositories:** Scarcity of centralized, interactive platforms specifically designed for comprehensive cultural corpus data collection.

* **Limited Community Engagement in Data Curation:** Constrained opportunities for native speakers and cultural experts to directly contribute to and validate datasets.

* **Unstructured Data Collection Practices:** Ad-hoc efforts result in fragmented and inconsistent datasets, hindering large-scale research utility.

## 3. Solution Overview: Idi-Emiti ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

Idi-Emiti provides an interactive web-based platform meticulously designed to facilitate, standardize, and scale the collection of **image, audio, and video files** along with associated metadata for regional Indian cultural objects.

**Key Data Elements Collected:**
