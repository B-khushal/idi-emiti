# Cultural Corpus Collection Platform: Project Roadmap

**Project Goal:** To create an interactive web-based platform for collecting structured, high-quality multimodal (image, audio, video) cultural corpus data with rich metadata for advanced AI and linguistic research, especially for regional Indian languages.

**Key Data Elements (Refined from Project Idea Evaluation):**
* **Media Files:** Image, Audio, Video
* **Metadata:**
    * Geolocation (precise coordinates)
    * Contributor Details (user identification for tracking/acknowledgment)
    * Corpus Category
    * Title of Input Data
    * Description of Input Data (multilingual support)

## Phase 1: Core Data Model & Basic Ingestion

**Focus:** Establishing the foundational data structures and the basic ability to ingest the new, richer data types.

**Milestones:**
* **M1.1:** Defined comprehensive database schema for all new data types.
* **M1.2:** Proof-of-concept for storing and retrieving a single multimodal entry.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Database Design:**
    * **Detailed Schema Design:** Design the robust database schema that accommodates all specified data types:
        * Media storage paths (for images, audio, video).
        * Geolocation (latitude, longitude fields).
        * Contributor details (user ID, possibly name/email with privacy considerations).
        * Categorization (hierarchical? free text? controlled vocabulary?).
        * Title and Description fields (with multilingual support strategy).
    * **Choose Database Solution:** Finalize the choice between a robust RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL for production-readiness) or continue with SQLite if complexity is manageable for this phase.
2.  **Backend Media Upload & Storage:**
    * Implement secure file upload mechanisms for images, audio, and video.
    * Set up a scalable storage solution (e.g., local file system initially, moving towards cloud storage like AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage for production).
    * Develop APIs for uploading and retrieving multimodal data.
3.  **Frontend Form Updates:**
    * Modify the existing prototype form to include input fields for:
        * **File Upload:** Dedicated fields for image, audio, video files.
        * **Geolocation Input:** Manual input fields for latitude/longitude (initially, consider integration with map pickers later).
        * **All new metadata fields:** Contributor details, category, title, description.
    * Ensure basic validation on the frontend.
4.  **Initial Data Pipeline:**
    * Establish the basic flow for ingested data from frontend to backend to database.
    * Verify that all data types are correctly stored and retrievable.
5.  **Project Management & Coordination:**
    * Regular stand-ups to track progress and address blockers.
    * Refine existing `CONTRIBUTING.md` and internal documentation with new data requirements.

## Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience & Robust Backend

**Focus:** Improving contributor experience, enhancing data quality features, and building out the robust backend infrastructure.

**Milestones:**
* **M2.1:** Functional multimodal submission with enhanced UI.
* **M2.2:** Initial data validation and basic curation tools in place.
* **M2.3:** Secure user authentication system implemented.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Geolocation Integration:**
    * **Frontend:** Implement a map-based picker for geolocation input (e.g., using Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap or Google Maps API).
    * **Backend:** Ensure robust handling and validation of geocoordinate data.
2.  **Multilingual Input Enhancement:**
    * Refine the UI for multilingual description input (e.g., tabbed interface, language selector).
    * Ensure consistent encoding and storage of multilingual text.
3.  **Contributor Authentication & Profile:**
    * Implement a robust user authentication system (e.g., using a suitable framework for your chosen backend language).
    * Develop basic user profiles to manage contributor details and track submissions.
    * Integrate secure session management.
4.  **Data Validation & Quality Checks:**
    * Implement server-side validation for all input fields (file types, sizes, required fields, coordinate ranges).
    * Begin developing automated quality assessment heuristics (e.g., basic checks for duplicate titles, missing descriptions).
5.  **Analytics Dashboard (Initial):**
    * Develop initial real-time metrics for data submission rates, media type distribution, and language distribution.
    * Visualize corpus growth over time.
6.  **Admin Panel Enhancements (Initial):**
    * Begin building an admin interface for basic data review and management.
    * Implement secure administrator authentication.

## Phase 3: Curation, Search, & Scalability

**Focus:** Enabling efficient data curation, implementing search functionality, and preparing for large-scale deployment.

**Milestones:**
* **M3.1:** Functional data curation tools for administrators.
* **M3.2:** Basic search and filtering capabilities for the corpus.
* **M3.3:** Deployment strategy defined and initial cloud setup.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Advanced Curation Tools:**
    * **Admin Review Interface:** Develop a comprehensive admin interface for reviewing, editing, approving, or rejecting submitted entries.
    * **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a way for curators to provide feedback to contributors (if applicable).
    * **Version Control for Data:** Consider how to manage changes/updates to submitted data (e.g., simple audit logs).
2.  **Search & Filtering:**
    * Implement basic text search across titles and descriptions.
    * Add filtering options by category, language, and media type.
    * Consider integrating a dedicated search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch, if needed for full-text search scalability later).
3.  **Data Export Functionality:**
    * Allow administrators to export filtered subsets of the corpus data (e.g., CSV, JSON).
4.  **Scalability & Deployment Planning:**
    * **Cloud Infrastructure:** Plan for deployment on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalable storage and compute.
    * **Containerization:** Explore Docker for containerizing the application for easier deployment.
    * **Monitoring & Logging:** Set up basic application monitoring and logging.
5.  **Community Engagement Strategy:**
    * Refine the strategy for engaging native speakers and cultural experts.
    * Plan pilot programs or initial outreach efforts.

    * Showcase initial results or use cases.
4.  **Performance Optimization:**
    * Optimize database queries, media serving, and frontend rendering for large datasets.
5.  **Documentation & User Guides:**
    * Develop comprehensive user guides for contributors and researchers.
    * Detailed API documentation.

**Important Considerations Throughout the Project:**

* **Agile Methodology:** This roadmap is iterative. Embrace an agile approach with regular sprints, stand-ups, and retrospectives to adapt to new insights.
* **Security & Privacy:** Integrate security best practices from day one. Continuously review and update privacy policies, especially regarding user data and geolocation.
* **Testing:** Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure code quality and system reliability.
* **User Feedback:** Regularly collect feedback from potential contributors and curators to guide development.
* **Accessibility:** Continuously ensure the platform adheres to web accessibility standards.
* **Tech Stack Review:** As requirements evolve, periodically review your tech stack to ensure it remains the most suitable choice. You may need to introduce new libraries or services for handling multimodal data efficiently (e.g., specialized media processing libraries).
